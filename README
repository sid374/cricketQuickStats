This program is supposed to provide quick comparison stats for ipl players. (Should be useful for building fantasy teams).

This project aims parses Stats of International Cricket players from iplt20.com, stores them in a mongodb database, and then queries the database based on user input. At the momemnt there is a very simple(almost non-existent) GUI, which I need to work on as and when I get time.

To run as is right now follow these steps:
1.  playerData.py : This should download player data in json format to a folder in the current working directory.
2.  parseFile.py: This will parse the above files and store the data in mongodb.
3.  findPlayer.py : This is the main user program, with the UI and everything.

This is still a work in progress...
